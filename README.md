# E-Clinic
Back in 10th grade, I was just starting to get familiar with Java. So I decided to do a project so that I become familiar with the basics of Java.<br>
This project is just a massive bunch of conditional statements that analyse your symptoms and provide a more or less accurate guess of the disease you may have and provides medication for the same.<br>
**Lines of Code**: 390 (I know right?)
<br>

P.S. Don't judge me for the code. I was just a kid. :P
<br>

## Hindsight
Not a bad little project for a 14 year old new to coding, eh?
